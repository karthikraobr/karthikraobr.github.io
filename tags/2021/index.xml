      <description>2020 was a whirlwind of a year. Even in my wildest dreams, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have imagined that our generation would be experiencing a pandemic let alone a pandemic that lasted an entire year and crippled lots of people&amp;rsquo;s life. I am grateful for being one of the privileged few who could work from home and didn&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about making ends meet and my heart is filled with gratitude for the frontline workers who risked their lives to make sure that essentials were delivered, patients were nursed and people were fed just to name a few.</description>
