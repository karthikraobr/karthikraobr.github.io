      <description>I didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy running until recently. I would occasionally run a 10k and train for a week or two prior to that and that would be it. Once I moved to Berlin, one of the first things I did apart from hunting for houses was to sign up for the Berlin Half-marathon with a friend of mine. That was a life changing experience. Allow me to explain.
Stress buster When I started, I always thought that running was just about having a strong pair of legs.</description>
