      <description>Here are a few reasons why I hate Go:
Syntax In my previous post I raved about how Go has a clean syntax, but here are a few reaons why I hate it :
 Anything that starts with a uppercase is exported i.e. it is accessible from outside a package. Names starting with a lowercase are not exported.
 No built-in enum support. As a developer with some background in C# I miss enums.</description>

      <description>I was introduced to Go by Bjoern as a part of my student job and I have been smitten by it ever since. Here are a few reason&amp;rsquo;s why I love go, in no particular order :

      <description>I have been thinking of updating my blog for more than a month now and you all guessed it right, I procrastinated. What better way to update it, than write a post about procrastination. When someone asks me &amp;ldquo;What am I good at&amp;rdquo;? my immediate answer would be procrastination. I am full-time procrastinator! I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why I do it and how I do it, but at the end of the day I realize that I wasted it procrastinating.</description>

      <description>So! los gehts (german for here we go). Hello World! This is usually the first program developers&amp;rsquo; write to get the taste of a new programming language. I am new to blogging and hence this post! Considering how long I have been working with computers, I am pretty late to the blogging scene, but hey better late than never. I still haven&amp;rsquo;t decided what I will be posting here. Stay Tuned, Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish!</description>
